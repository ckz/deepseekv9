This warning is coming from AutoGen and it's related to the cost configuration for the Claude 3 Sonnet model when using OpenRouter. Let's fix this by adding the proper cost configuration.

Here's how to update your config list to include the pricing for Claude 3 Sonnet:

```python
config_list = [
    {
        "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        "api_key": "your_openrouter_api_key",
        "model": "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet",
        "price": {
            "prompt_token": 0.01563,  # $15.63 per 1M tokens
            "completion_token": 0.04688  # $46.88 per 1M tokens
        }
    }
]
```

Or if you're using a dictionary configuration:

```python:swarm_demo/.env
config = {
    "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    "api_key": "your_openrouter_api_key",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet",
    "price": {
        "prompt_token": 0.01563,
        "completion_token": 0.04688
    }
}
```

These prices are based on OpenRouter's current pricing for Claude 3 Sonnet. The warning will go away once you add this pricing information to your configuration.

Could you share the code where you're setting up your AutoGen configuration? That way, I can provide more specific guidance on where to add these price settings.
